  * Using a camera placed on an Industrial Robotic Arm, implementing a multi-view object 6D pose estimation.  
  * Automated processing of CAD models to compute optimal assembly sequence, robotic task sequence, and trajectories to perform end-to-end assembly using tools.  
* Co-authored two papers at a leading international conference in Robotics \- ICRA.  
* As a research leader, established research culture in the department, including Paper Reading Club, Show\&Tells for effective knowledge exchange, Technology Readiness Levels tracking framework for successful transition of research into development.  
* Coordinated collaboration between multiple teams that led to the implementation of SotA algorithms and methods in production.

## 01.05.2019 \- 01.08.2019

### [**Samsung AI Center**](https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-launches-ai-center-in-russia)**, Moscow, Russia** *\- Lead Engineer*

* I led a project to implement a know-how Deep Learning-based Visual Odometry pipeline on a physical robot using ROS and PyTorch, demonstrating the robustness of the model in practice.  
* I supervised two student interns, formulating the projects for them and guiding their daily tasks.

## 01.02.2018 \- 01.04.2019

### [**Lvl5.ai**](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/lvl5)**, Moscow, Russia / San Francisco, US (remote)** *\- Senior Data Scientist, Team Lead*

* As a second hire, I played a crucial role in developing the core technology for the company \- a computer vision algorithm that combined multiple dashcam videos with GPS into a 3D representation of the road \- HD map. The algorithm included a few ML models \- for object detection and semantic segmentation, and a unique Structure-from-Motion algorithm, fusing the results in 3D space.  
* My role involved defining the company’s know-how technology and PoC implementation. Later I was responsible for hiring a team of 3 people to build the MVP together.  
* The company has been successfully acquired by an American delivery giant DoorDash.

### [**Connectome.ai**](https://connectome.ai/en/)**, Moscow, Russia** *\- Chief Data Scientist, CTO*

* I joined the company at its inception, and during my time there led the development of the first computer vision products \- sanitary inspection and quality inspection for meat production facilities. The tech stack included object detection and classification ML models, an object tracking algorithm, and integration with physical devices, such as physical cameras and security gates. Both products were successfully demoed to the customer and later implemented in production.  
* My role involved individual contributions such as training models and writing code, as well as team management and hiring.

## 01.06.2015 \- 01.08.2017

### [**Yandex**](https://yandex.com/company/)**, Moscow, Russia** *\- Research Engineer*

* I worked in a small R\&D team working on various computer vision projects, that later became the core team of the Self-Driving Car project.  
* I have been responsible for building proofs-of-concept and integration of prototypes, to show the feasibility of Computer Vision and ML technologies for use in Yandex products.  
* When the Self-Driving Project started, I contributed to the architecture design and the choice of algorithmic approaches. I implemented a significant portion of the first ROS-based prototype that used cameras, radar, GPS, and LIDAR to drive. I also actively participated in field testing, experimentation, data collection, and labeling.  
* During my work there I presented one of the team’s projects \- real-time free parking space detection \- at an international conference \- Nvidia GTC Europe in Amsterdam in Sept 2016\.
